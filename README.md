A repository for exploring the usefulness of "recolorize" for beetle photo correction and maybe recognition.

The minimum success threshold for this repository is a workflow that enables increased automation/batch processing of beetle images to remove flash marks and reduce the colour complexity of elytral patterns without significantly imapcting accuracy. Additionally, this package may allow for individual identification, though this is less feasible.
